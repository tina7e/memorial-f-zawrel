# In Memory of Friedrich Zawrel

In Memory of Friedrich Zawrel is a memorial to the Nazi euthanasia survivor Friedrich Zawrel. The site aims to make his life story accessible to an English-speaking younger generations by presenting the information in an intuitive, user-friendly and media-supported way. The site has a secondary aim of making users connect Zawrel's story to current political events and ethical questions. The site addresses both, users who want to learn about Zawrel and educators who might find it useful as class material. A small catalogue of questions to discuss in class has been added to the page.

## Features 

### Existing Features

- __Custom Favicon__

The website has a custom favicon. 

- __Navigation Bar__

 A full responsive navigation bar is featured on all pages. It includes links to the home page, resources page and guestbook page. 
 
 The nav bar is sticky so that users can easily access navigation even though the page scrolls down quite a bit. 
 
 The sticky nav bar separates from the page logo when scrolling in order to save space.

- __The intro section__

The intro section equips the user with a quick introduction of the site's contents. It explains who Friedrich Zawrel was. It is accompanied by a background image of an old blurry newspaper article. 

In the smaller size screens we only see Zawrel's image from the article, but in larger size screens, as the image quality deteriorates beyond usable, part of the article text is also shown. The image quality is still not very good but I think the context of it being an image of an old newspaper, and the page being about a historical figure, justifies the image quality. 

The introductory text scrolls over the fixed image on a semitransparent black background. This contrasts the grainy picture with a nifty, modern sleek look and adds visual interest. The text box is fitted with a little down arrow to signal the users that there is more scrollable content below.

- __Childhood section__

  - The childhood section is the first of the three (planned: 5) biographical sections that make up the meat of the site. 
  
  It lets the user enter the narrative of Zawrel's life. The text is kept short and on point in order to keep readers interested. It is split up over two square divs to reduce information overload and make it visually appealing. The color scheme is reverted and the div backgrounds are given round edges. The background image to the section is a grainy video still of Hitler Youth marching in Austria. It is not fixed but scrolls with the text. This again, adds visual interest. 

![Club Ethos](https://github.com/lucyrush/readme-template/blob/master/media/love_running_ethos.png)

- __Am Spiegelgrund section__

  - This section narrates briefly Zawrel's experiences in the clinic Am Spiegelgrund. It is styled with another fixed background, which, different from the intro picture, now fills the entire screen. The textbox has the same colour scheme and background style as the intro section's textbox. 

  - The main text is accompanied by an aside, visually separated in a div with a dark grey background. The aside textbox is similar to the ones in the childhood section. The text delivers facts about the clinic "Am Spiegelgrund." It is accompanied by an old areal photograph. The photograph has a caption.  

![Meetup Times](https://github.com/lucyrush/readme-template/blob/master/media/love_running_times.png)

- __Meeting Gross section__

  - This section is the most text-heavy and the most climactic part of the narrative. It is kept simple, separated in paragraphs, white text on a dark background. The textbox shares features from both previous textbox styles. 


  __Guestbook entry form__

  - At the end of the narrative, users are invited to share their thoughts on Friedrich Zawrel's story.
  - They can do so via a simple form that features an optional text input field for their name, an obligatory e-mail input field and an obligatory textarray field for the message. 

__The Footer__

- The footer is fixed to the bottom of the page and visible at all times. It includes links to a few social media sites that will open in a new tab. 






![Footer](https://github.com/lucyrush/readme-template/blob/master/media/love_running_footer.png)

- __The Guestbook page__

  - The guestbook page consist of a simple table that lists messages left, optionally with the sender's name. 

![Gallery](https://github.com/lucyrush/readme-template/blob/master/media/love_running_gallery.png)

- __The Resources page__

  - This page features relevant resources that the users can peruse to further their knowledge about Friedrich Zawrel and the things he experienced. It includes an embedded video of an interview with Zawrel (in German), additional photos and a list of thematically sorted links that might be of interest to the user.

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement

- To complete the story, two more sections of the biography are necessary. Of these, the last one would break up the black-grey-white scheme and introduce some photographs in colour. 
- The resources list should also have a catalogue of questions and current developments in society and politics that an educator might want to use to discuss with their students on the background of Zawrel's experiences. 
- A list of image sources should be included on the resource list. 
- The footer should have more relevant information and links.  
- The paragraphs in the Meeting Gross section should be styled for different screen sizes to be more digestible.
- The favicon should be changed. I liked the feeling of this image but it seems to have a specific meaning in the Portuguese or the union context.



## Testing 
 
I was only able to test with devtools and on my private/office laptop, desktop and my own mobile phone.  My phone showed a bug that went undetected in devtools and that I was then able to fix. (The second textbox of the Childhood section had overlapped into the Spiegelgrund section.)

I'm aware that there are some layout issues still with larger screen sizes. I wish I had more time to tweak those.

I'm also aware that the image quality, especially the background image on the landing page, is suboptimal. However, I felt that using the image would be justified by the historical context of the page. 


In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your projectâ€™s features and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Credits 

I have started following the steps for basic page set-up from the Love Running Walkthrough. I recreated the code used to create header and footer, and to push the footer down.

I have looked up bits and pieces on various pages online but I believe that mostly I haven't outright copied code, rather looked it up and adjusted it to my specific situation. 

One exception to this is the code for the iframe on the Resources page. I took it from this website: https://www.h3xed.com/web-development/how-to-make-a-responsive-100-width-youtube-iframe-embed

## Other General Project Advice

Below you will find a couple of extra tips that may be helpful when completing your project. Remember that each of these projects will become part of your final portfolio so itâ€™s important to allow enough time to showcase your best work! 

- One of the most basic elements of keeping a healthy commit history is with the commit message. When getting started with your project, read through [this article](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) by Chris Beams on How to Write  a Git Commit Message 
  - Make sure to keep the messages in the imperative mood 

- When naming the files in your project directory, make sure to consider meaningful naming of files, point to specific names and sections of content.
  - For example, instead of naming an image used â€˜image1.pngâ€™ consider naming it â€˜landing_page_img.pngâ€™. This will ensure that there are clear file paths kept. 

- Do some extra research on good and bad coding practices, there are a handful of useful articles to read, consider reviewing the following list when getting started:
  - [Writing Your Best Code](https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/writing-your-best-code/)
  - [HTML & CSS Coding Best Practices](https://medium.com/@inceptiondj.info/html-css-coding-best-practice-fadb9870a00f)
