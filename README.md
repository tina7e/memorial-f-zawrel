# In Memory of Friedrich Zawrel

In Memory of Friedrich Zawrel is a memorial to the Nazi euthanasia survivor Friedrich Zawrel. The site aims to make his life story accessible to an English-speaking younger generations by presenting the information in an intuitive, user-friendly and media-supported way. The site has a secondary aim of making users connect Zawrel's story to current political events and ethical questions. The site addresses both, users who want to learn about Zawrel and educators who might find it useful as class material. A small catalogue of questions to discuss in class has been added to the page.

## Features 

### Existing Features

- __Custom Favicon__

The website has a custom favicon. 

![Favicon](https://github.com/tina7e/memorial-f-zawrel/commit/0ce5f294d25aaf577cba43f6fd1d4bd8f05525da#diff-94a29539a33142a6989aefecd8f33f4f413a1092367dce6d4e2c0ca5ef6184c1?raw=true)

- __Navigation Bar__

 A full responsive navigation bar is featured on all pages. It includes links to the home page, resources page and guestbook page. 
 
 The nav bar is sticky so that users can easily access navigation even though the page scrolls down quite a bit. 
 
 The sticky nav bar separates from the page logo when scrolling in order to save space.


![Header and Nav Bar](https://github.com/tina7e/memorial-f-zawrel/commit/0ce5f294d25aaf577cba43f6fd1d4bd8f05525da#diff-c30af4a95577cbbb8e5f936faa2e21cf64a9b0a30b1ee146f20d2b3fbe0becfa?raw=true)


- __The Intro Section__

The intro section equips the user with a quick introduction of the site's contents. It explains who Friedrich Zawrel was. It is accompanied by a background image of an old blurry newspaper article. 

In the smaller size screens we only see Zawrel's image from the article, but in larger size screens, as the image quality deteriorates beyond usable, part of the article text is also shown. The image quality is still not very good but I think the context of it being an image of an old newspaper, and the page being about a historical figure, justifies the image quality. 

The introductory text scrolls over the fixed image on a semitransparent black background. This contrasts the grainy picture with a nifty, modern sleek look and adds visual interest. The text box is fitted with a little down arrow to signal the users that there is more scrollable content below.

- __Childhood section__

  - The childhood section is the first of the three (planned: 5) biographical sections that make up the meat of the site. 
  
  It lets the user enter the narrative of Zawrel's life. The text is kept short and on point in order to keep readers interested. It is split up over two square divs to reduce information overload and make it visually appealing. The color scheme is reverted and the div backgrounds are given round edges. The background image to the section is a grainy video still of Hitler Youth marching in Austria. It is not fixed but scrolls with the text. This again, adds visual interest.

- __Am Spiegelgrund section__

  - This section narrates briefly Zawrel's experiences in the clinic Am Spiegelgrund. It is styled with another fixed background, which, different from the intro picture, now fills the entire screen. The textbox has the same colour scheme and background style as the intro section's textbox. 

  - The main text is accompanied by an aside, visually separated in a div with a dark grey background. The aside textbox is similar to the ones in the childhood section. The text delivers facts about the clinic "Am Spiegelgrund." It is accompanied by an old areal photograph. The photograph has a caption.  

![Spiegelgrund section](https://github.com/tina7e/memorial-f-zawrel/commit/0ce5f294d25aaf577cba43f6fd1d4bd8f05525da#diff-e4eaac84f14c350a7a93802f59b1c31b7313247669b2bd5cce55cc3dfc83c89d?raw=true)


- __Meeting Gross section__

  - This section is the most text-heavy and the most climactic part of the narrative. It is kept simple, separated in paragraphs, white text on a dark background. The textbox shares features from both previous textbox styles. 


  -__Guestbook entry form__

  - At the end of the narrative, users are invited to share their thoughts on Friedrich Zawrel's story.
  - They can do so via a simple form that features an optional text input field for their name, an obligatory e-mail input field and an obligatory textarray field for the message. 

  ![Guestbook entry form](https://github.com/tina7e/memorial-f-zawrel/commit/0ce5f294d25aaf577cba43f6fd1d4bd8f05525da#diff-f683fabbea513b2dc4ed5b95523befa1ee991ef677fc4cb6a6beb20b0d31521f?raw=true)

  -__The Guestbook page__

  _A simple table that shows the messages users have entered.

 - __The Resources page__

  - A page with further resources. In its current form it hosts an embedded video with an interview with Zawrel and a few links to informative pages.

  ![Resources page](https://github.com/tina7e/memorial-f-zawrel/commit/0ce5f294d25aaf577cba43f6fd1d4bd8f05525da#diff-3fa5c0a76722a60ef82d4e1a93027f4104d78ae3cc9b6d8c2dc9b66f8a1e2005?raw=true)



-__The Footer__

- The footer is fixed to the bottom of the page and visible at all times. It includes links to a few social media sites that will open in a new tab.

### Features Left to Implement

- To complete the story, two more sections of the biography are necessary. Of these, the last one would break up the black-grey-white scheme and introduce some photographs in colour. 
- The resources list should also have a catalogue of questions and current developments in society and politics that an educator might want to use to discuss with their students on the background of Zawrel's experiences. 
- A list of image sources should be included on the resource list. 
- The footer should have more relevant information and links.  
- The paragraphs in the Meeting Gross section should be styled for different screen sizes to be more digestible.
- The favicon should be changed. I liked the feeling of this image but it seems to have a specific meaning in the Portuguese or the union context.



## Testing 
 
I was only able to test with devtools and on my private/office laptop, desktop and my own mobile phone.  My phone showed a bug that went undetected in devtools and that I was then able to fix. (The second textbox of the Childhood section had overlapped into the Spiegelgrund section.)

I'm aware that there are some layout issues still with larger screen sizes. I wish I had more time to tweak those.

I'm also aware that the image quality, especially the background image on the landing page, is suboptimal. However, I felt that using the image would be justified by the historical context of the page. 


In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your projectâ€™s features and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

### Unfixed Bugs

- The guestbook form doesn't actually work since I am not able to create a MySQL database for it yet. 


## Deployment

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows: 
  - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab 
  - From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
  - Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.

## Credits 

I have started following the steps for basic page set-up from the Love Running Walkthrough. I recreated the code used to create header and footer, and to push the footer down.

I have looked up bits and pieces on various pages online but I believe that mostly I haven't outright copied code, rather looked it up and adjusted it to my specific situation. 

One exception to this is the code for the iframe on the Resources page. I took most of it from this website: https://www.h3xed.com/web-development/how-to-make-a-responsive-100-width-youtube-iframe-embed. And then adjusted it a little.
