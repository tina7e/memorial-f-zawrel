                        the
                        cruelty of medicine and psychia&shy;try under the ideology of "racial hygiene". It further
                        illustrates
                        that this ideology permeates the medical field far beyond 1945 al&shy;low&shy;ing careers begun under
                        its
                        premise to prosper into our cur&shy;rent millennium. Above all, it shows the necessity and
                        impor&shy;tance
                        of continued resistance.

                    <p>
                        Friedrich Zawrel's childhood in Vienna is overshadowed by bitter poverty and the alcohol
                        addiction
                        of his father. Early on he is ta&shy;ken into foster care and spends periods in educational
                        institu&shy;tions.
                        During a short-lived re&shy;turn to the family setting in 1940, Friedrich receives a letter that
                        excludes him from joining any NSDAP organizations because of his
                        father's exemption to serve.

                <div id="childhood-text-2">

                    <p> When he doesn't join the Hitler Youth, Friedrich is ostracized and bullied by his
                        classmates. He recounts that the other boys wagered that the reason for his exclusion couldn't
                        be
                        that he was Jewish because in that case "he'd be in a concentration camp". In his later
                        years,
                        Zawrel would point out how improbable it was that the general population wasn't aware of the
                        Holocaust, when
                        even school children knew about it.

                <div id="spiegelgrund-text-1">

                    <p>In 1941, Friedrich Zawrel is taken into custody again and transferred to the municipal
                        educational facility "Am Spiegelgrund" where he spends most of the next three years in an isolation
                        cell.
                        He witnesses other patients including children disappearing over night while the resident
                        doctors
                        use him to demonstrate to prospective nurses which of his bodily features make him
                        "lebensunwert" ("unworthy of life").
                        Am-Spiegelgrund doctor Heinrich Gross tortures Zawrel with "medical" experiments and declares
                        him "hereditarily and socially inferior". In 1944, a nurse helps Friedrich Zawrel to flee the
                        institution.

                        facility "Am Steinhof" in Wien between 1940 and 1944. The facility comprised an educational home and a psychiatric clinic for children, including a "child specialist department", where sick, disabled and "non-educable"
                        children were exposed to medical experiments and torture. At least 789 children were murdered.
