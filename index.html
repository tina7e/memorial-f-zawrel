                    <p> This page is dedicated to the memory of Friedrich Zawrel, whose life story serves witness to
                        the
                        cruelty of medicine and psychia&shy;try under the ideology of "racial hygiene". It further
                        illustrates
                        that this ideology permeates the medical field far beyond 1945 al&shy;low&shy;ing careers begun
                        under
                        its
                        premise to prosper into our cur&shy;rent millennium. Above all, it shows the necessity and
                        impor&shy;tance
                        of continued resistance.

                    <p>
                        Friedrich Zawrel's childhood in Vienna is overshadowed by bitter poverty and the alcohol
                        addiction
                        of his father. Early on he is ta&shy;ken into foster care and spends periods in educational
                        institu&shy;tions.
                        During a short-lived re&shy;turn to the family setting in 1940, Friedrich receives a letter that
                        excludes him from joining any NSDAP organizations because of his
                        father's exemption to serve.

                <div id="childhood-text-2">

                    <p> When he doesn't join the Hitler Youth, Friedrich is ostracized and bullied by his
                        classmates. He recounts that the other boys wagered that the reason for his exclusion couldn't
                        be
                        that he was Jewish because in that case "he'd be in a concentration camp". In his later
                        years,
                        Zawrel would point out how improbable it was that the general population wasn't aware of the
                        Holocaust, when
                        even school children knew about it.

                <div id="spiegelgrund-text">

                    <p>In 1941, Friedrich Zawrel is taken into custody again and transferred to the municipal
                        educational facility "Am Spiegelgrund" where he spends most of the next three years in an
                        isolation
                        cell.
                        He witnesses other patients including children disappearing over night while the resident
                        doctors
                        use him to demonstrate to prospective nurses which of his bodily features make him
                        "lebensunwert" ("unworthy of life").
                        Am-Spiegelgrund doctor Heinrich Gross tortures Zawrel with "medical" experiments and declares
                        him "hereditarily and socially inferior". In 1944, a nurse helps Friedrich Zawrel flee the
                        institution.

                        facility "Am Steinhof" in Wien between 1940 and 1944. The facility comprised an educational home
                        and a psychiatric clinic for children, including a "child specialist department", where sick,
                        disabled and "non-educable"
                        children were exposed to medical experiments and torture. At least 789 children were murdered.

                    <h2>Meeting Doctor Gross again</h2>

                    <p>In the following decades, Friedrich Zawrel struggles to adjust to society and gets caught up in
                        petty
                        crime. 30 years after the war, he is being tried for property offenses and finds himself facing
                        Am-Spiegelgrund doctor Heinrich Gross at
                        court. Gross had built an impressive career on the base of his "research" at Am Spiegelgrund and
                        is at this time the most requested court psychiatrist in Austria.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>

                        Facing Gross at court, Zawrel says: "Believe me, I know people, who have committed crimes
                        hundreds of thousands times worse than I, but they are respected persons today, that is in high
                        positions and such."
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>

                        Gross doesn't understand nor recognize Zawrel, and asks if he has ever been committed to
                        psychiatric
                        care before. Zawrel replies: "Herr Doktor, for an academic, you do have a very bad memory. [...]
                        Herr Doktor, can you even sleep well anymore? Have you already forgotten, the many dead children
                        of Pavillon 15, have you already forgotten the tortured and abused children of Pavillon 17?"
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Court psychiatrist Gross claims not to be biased. In the psychiatric appraisal of Zawrel that he
                        composes for the court, he then recommends that Friedrich Zawrel be imprisoned permanently
                        in an instutition for dangerous repeat offenders. He bases this appraisal on a psychiatric
                        evaluation that his Am Spiegelgrund colleague Ernst Illing had written in 1943. It attested that
                        Friedrich Zawrel came from "a genetically and sociologically inferior family", "a criminal,
                        asocial tribe". Illing had been hanged in 1946 for about 200 murders committed at Am
                        Spiegelgrund.
